    <h2>Scholarship Application Process</h2>
    <p>
      The Sri Lanka Student Empowerment Foundation (SLSEF) follows a transparent and fair selection process to ensure that scholarships are awarded to deserving students with genuine financial needs. The following steps outline the complete process from application to award.
    </p>

    <section>
      <h3>1. Application Collection</h3>
      <p>
        Applications are collected from a selected set of schools across Sri Lanka. Eligible students can apply by completing the official SLSEF Scholarship Application Form, available through participating schools or our online platform.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>2. Initial Screening</h3>
      <p>
        After reviewing all applications, a shortlist of candidates will be prepared based on financial need and academic merit. Shortlisted students will be contacted and asked to provide supporting documents to verify their financial background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless there is a strong reason not to award the scholarship, all shortlisted candidates who complete the next steps successfully will be granted the scholarship.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>3. Collecting Additional Documents</h3>
      <p>
        Shortlisted students must submit the following documents:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>A letter certified by the <strong>Grama Niladhari Officer</strong> confirming the applicant’s financial situation.</li>
        <li>A certified copy of the official government-issued <strong>O/L certificate</strong>.</li>
        <li>(Optional) For current A/L students — a letter from the school confirming <strong>results from the last term’s exams</strong> will be useful.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>4. Interview</h3>
      <p>
        Selected students will be invited for a short interview conducted remotely via a video communication platform such as Zoom. This step helps us understand the applicant’s goals, motivation, and circumstances better.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>5. Scholarships Are Awarded</h3>
      <p>
        Students who successfully complete all previous steps and meet the eligibility criteria will be officially awarded the SLSEF scholarship. Each recipient will receive LKR 5,000 per month for a period of one year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on performance and continued financial need, scholarships may be extended for an additional year.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h3>6. Midterm Check-in</h3>
      <p>
        Six months after the award, SLSEF conducts a midterm progress check with each student. This check ensures that recipients are continuing their studies successfully and maintaining good progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        In rare cases, a scholarship may be discontinued due to unsatisfactory progress or failure to attend the midterm check-in.
